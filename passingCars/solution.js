// A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. 
//The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
// Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
//       0 represents a car traveling east,
//       1 represents a car traveling west.
// The goal is to count passing cars.
// We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, 
//                     is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
